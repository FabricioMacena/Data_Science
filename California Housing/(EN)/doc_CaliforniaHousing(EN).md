# California Housing :derelict_house:
This dataset can be found in this [repository](https://github.com/FabricioMacena/Data_Science/blob/main/California%20Housing/housing.csv) and in [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/camnugent/california-housing-prices).

## Context
> This is the dataset used in the second chapter of Aurélien Géron's recent book 'Hands-On Machine learning with Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow'. It serves as an excellent introduction to implementing machine learning algorithms because it requires rudimentary data cleaning, has an easily understandable list of variables and sits at an optimal size between being to toyish and too cumbersome.

## Content
> The data pertains to the houses found in a given California district and some summary stats about them based on the 1990 census data. Be warned the data aren't cleaned so there are some preprocessing steps required! The columns are as follows, their names are pretty self explanitory
