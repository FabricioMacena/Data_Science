The dataset can be found in this [repository](https://github.com/FabricioMacena/Data_Science/blob/main/Marketing%20Campaing/superstore_data.csv) and on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ahsan81/superstore-marketing-campaign-dataset).

## Context

> A store is planning the year-end clearance. They want to launch a new offer â€“ gold membership, which provides a 20% discount on all purchases, for only $499, which is $999 on other days. It will be valid only for existing customers, and the campaign through phone calls is currently being planned for them. Management believes that the best way to reduce the campaign's cost is to create a predictive model that classifies customers who might acquire the offer.

> Each sample in the database consists of customer data, including categories such as the quantity of products purchased, frequency, annual income, and most importantly, the response to the marketing campaign (target).
