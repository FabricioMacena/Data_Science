# Brazilian E-Commerce by Olyst :department_store:
The files can be found in this [repository](https://github.com/FabricioMacena/Data_Analysis/tree/main/Brazillian%20E-Commerce%20by%20Olist/files) and in [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/olistbr/brazilian-ecommerce)

I converted the databases into a database to be manipulated with sqlite, but github does not allow the upload of files with more than 100mb, so I made the notebook available for conversion [here](https://github.com/FabricioMacena/Data_Analysis/blob/main/Brazillian%20E-Commerce%20by%20Olist/creating_the_database.ipynb)

## Context
This dataset was generously provided by Olist, the largest department store in Brazilian marketplaces. Olist connects small businesses from all over Brazil to channels without hassle and with a single contract. Those merchants are able to sell their products through the Olist Store and ship them directly to the customers using Olist logistics partners. See more on our website: www.olist.com
After a customer purchases the product from Olist Store a seller gets notified to fulfill that order. Once the customer receives the product, or the estimated delivery date is due, the customer gets a satisfaction survey by email where he can give a note for the purchase experience and write down some comments.

## Content
